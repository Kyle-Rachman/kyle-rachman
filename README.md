# Hello friend! 👋

### About Me:
My name is Kyle Rachman, and I am so excited to "meet" you. I have lived on the beautiful Central Coast of California for the past six years, and I love Jesus, math, coding, and climbing!

I started my career as a mathematician and professional educator at both the high school and university levels, but I now seek to use the more technical side of my skillset as a Full Stack Developer. Some of my current skills include:

| Languages | Front End | Back End | Database |
|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Python | AJAX | Flask | MySQL |
| JavaScript (ES6) | React | jQuery | |
| HTML | Bootstrap | OOP | |
| CSS | JSON | AWS | |
|  | RESTful APIs | Jinja2 | |

### Active Projects:
- 🥷 Finishing the MERN stack at Coding Dojo
- 🧗‍♂️ Creating an app for climbers at my local gym to track their progress (ideation stage)
